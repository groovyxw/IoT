The project will focus on developing a machine learning model.

Assume that we have temperature and humidity data from the sensor.

We do not implement watering system, but we will make a decision system to trigger watering.

## Implementation

Defining a machine learning model

Preparing data

Building a machine learning model

Evaluating and testing a model
