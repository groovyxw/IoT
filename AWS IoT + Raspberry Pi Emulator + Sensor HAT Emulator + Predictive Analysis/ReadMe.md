we will develop a simple predictive analytics for IoT.
We will perform sensing to acquire temperature and humidity from the sensor devices(emulator).
Then, we send this sensor data to AWS Machine Learning to get a decision on whether the system will perform watering.

The project will focus on developing a machine learning model and make a decision system to trigger watering.

## Implementation

Defining a machine learning model

Preparing data

Building a machine learning model

Evaluating and testing a model


## How to Run?
Amazon AWS SageMaker Canvas
